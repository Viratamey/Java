Java does not have a concept of static classes directly, but you can have **static nested classes**. A static nested class is a class that is defined within another class and marked as `static`. It can be accessed without creating an instance of the outer class.

Example:

```
public class OuterClass {

    static class StaticNestedClass {

        void printMessage() {

            System.out.println("Inside static nested class");
    
        }

    }

}
```

You can use the static nested class like this: `OuterClass.StaticNestedClass obj = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();`.

### Abstract Class Vs Interface Summary of Differences:

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | No (single inheritance) | Yes (multiple inheritance) |
| **Methods** | Can have both abstract and concrete methods | Can have abstract, default, and static methods (Java 8+) |
| **Constructor** | Can have constructors | Cannot have constructors |
| **Fields** | Can have instance variables | Can only have `public static final` constants |
| **Access Modifiers** | Can have private, protected, public methods | All methods are implicitly `public` |
| **Use Case** | Use when you want shared implementation | Use when you want to define a contract for unrelated classes |

### When to Use Each:

-   **Use an abstract class** when:

    -   You want to share code among several related classes.
    -   You want to allow for default behavior that can be overridden by subclasses.
    -   You need to maintain a common base class with some shared state or functionality.
-   **Use an interface** when:

    -   You want to define a contract that can be implemented by any class.
    -   You want to enable multiple inheritance of functionality across different class hierarchies.
    -   You are defining behavior that is common across many classes with no need for shared state or implementation.
